Gonna let you down
We're broken people now

Home
A place where I can go
To take this of my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this of my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
Vers:
Look
I didn't power through this struggle
Just to let a little trouble
Knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed
After all of these decisions
All these mouth feed inches
They can't add up to the disses
That I have been through
Just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure
I'm still safe, I still ache
From trying to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign
I'm starting to loose faith
Now tell me
Hook:
How did all my dreams turn to nightmares
How did I loose it when I was right there
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why do life never fights fair
I'm trying to find
Chorus:
Home
A place where I can go
To take this of my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this of my shoulders
Someone take me home (It's been a long time comming)
Some one take me
Home
Oh oh oh oh ooohh
Home
Ooooh oohh
Someone take me home
Home
Oh oh oh oh ooohh
Home
Ooooh oohh
Vers:
Look
I've been through so much pain
That it's hard to maintain
Any smile on my face
'Cause it's madness on my brain
So i gotta make it back
But my home ain't on a map
Gotta follow all them feelings
To discover where it's at
I need the (Memories)
In case it fades forever
Just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (Enemies)
That give me the strength
To look the devil in the face
To make it home safe
Now tell me
Hook:
How did all my dreams turn to nightmares
How did I loose it when I was right there
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why do life never fights fair
I'm trying to find
Chorus:
Home
A place where I can go
To take this of my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me
Bridge:
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Chorus:
Someone take me
Home
Oh oh oh oh ooohh
Oh oh oooh
Someone take me
Home
Oh oh oh oh ooohh
Oh oh oooh
Someone take me
